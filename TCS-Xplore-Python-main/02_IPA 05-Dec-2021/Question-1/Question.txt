as an input from user) from a given list of strings.

pass the string as argument to a function. The function will take the strings
as argument and return Position(or index) of the list if the passed string is
present in the list, else it'll return "String not found". If the passed strings
is present at multiple indices, in that case the function should only return The
first index of occurrence.

considering the above scenario into account, build the logic to print the position
of passed string from a given list of strings.
